# re-create this

- I want to the header to include all the coloured part, and then have the text in the main and the contact details in the footer

-the font is an Arial rounded, but costs 65$, i therefore am choosing another font that hopefully comes close to the original

-reminder: add padding bottom to header

-#F89E9B for the little border under letter
